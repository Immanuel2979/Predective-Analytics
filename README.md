# Predective-Analytics
This predective model covers the branch of Data analytics, Machine Learning,using python programming language. Based on the given dataset, a predictive model was built to avoid the failure of equipments running in the industrial unit.
I have used EDA with feature engineering and gradient booster ML algorithm for the final predection model.
The F1 accuracy score board is 0-1 And the model accuracy is as shown in the model or as in below:
GB classifier training set accuracy: 0.9914200040111726 
 GB classifier test set accuracy: 0.990469450880577 
 F1 score: (0.8337580840543357, 0.7196296658768465, 0.7705455285010786, None)
